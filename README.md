# Elytra Slot

Elytra Slot is a mod that uses Curios API/Trinkets API to add an elytra slot to the player inventory and allows the
elytra to be placed into this slot. While the elytra is in this slot, it will grant the same flight capabilities as if
it was in your chestplate slot. This allows the player to gain the benefits of the elytra without sacrificing an armor
slot.
